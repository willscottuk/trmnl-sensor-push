# Contributing to TRMNL Sensor Push

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TRMNL Sensor Push integration for Home Assistant! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup
This is tricky because of the way Home Assistant handles integrations.

Once you have the integration installed then you can edit the files locally and send to the home assistant server via scp.

```bash
scp custom_components/trmnl_sensor_push/* user@homeassistant.local:/var/homeassistant/custom_components/trmnl_sensor_push
```
_You may need to change permissions on the files to make them writable._

You then need to restart the home assistant server to load the new files.

You can generate the API token from the Home Assistant web interface and then use that to restart the server.

```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HASS_API_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "${HASS_URL}/api/services/homeassistant/restart"
```
